Animation engine for Mathematical simulations in C++. This project is highly inspired from 3b1b's Manim.
LME is built with C++17 on Visual Studio 2019 and Windows 10 platform. It can be used for making Math videos as the animation is converted to videos on the fly. It consists of wide range of animation classes that can be used for Mathematical Simualations.\
NOTE: This project is highly under production.

# System Requirement
[Blend2d](https://blend2d.com/) The rendering engine of LME.\
[FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) Media Library used in LME for video encoding and muxing.\
[GMTL](http://ggt.sourceforge.net/html/main.html) Generic Math Template Library.

# Installation
Clone the project in Visual Studio 2019 or higher with C++ 17 enabled and handle all dependencies(see **Dependencies** section for more). Build the whole visual studio solution and run the example code.
